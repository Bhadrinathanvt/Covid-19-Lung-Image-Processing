# Covid-19 Lung Image Processing

This repository provides tools for analyzing lung images to measure COVID-19-related damage and predict future health risks. Using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer Vision (CV), it aims to assess lung health impacts, segment affected regions, and provide a damage score.

## Overview

COVID-19 can cause serious damage to lung tissue, with long-term health implications. This repository processes and analyzes lung CT scans and X-ray images to quantify this damage and predict potential future complications, providing insights for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Features
- **Image Segmentation:** Segment lung areas affected by COVID-19.
- **Damage Scoring:** Quantify the extent of lung tissue damage.
- **Future Risk Prediction:** Estimate potential health risks using predictive models.
- **Visualization:** Display damage and segmentation results on lung images.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhadrinathanvt/Covid-19-Lung-Image-Processing.git
cd covid19-lung-image-processing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include packages for image processing, machine learning, and data handling:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Usage

Run the main script with a directory of lung images to generate a damage report:

```bash
python analyze_lung_images.py --input_dir path/to/images --output_dir path/to/results
```

This will produce segmented images and a summary report with damage scoring.

## Methods

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository uses CNN models for feature extraction and classification. Pre-trained models (like [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) or [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)) can be fine-tuned on lung images for efficient COVID-19 damage detection.

### Computer Vision (CV) Techniques

Various CV techniques, including thresholding and edge detection, are applied for preprocessing, and morphological operations are used to isolate lung regions.

### Segmentation

- **U-Net Model:** A [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) architecture is used for precise lung segmentation, allowing clear analysis of COVID-19-affected regions.
- **Damage Scoring:** After segmentation, the affected regions are scored based on pixel density and spread.

### Future Risk Prediction

The repository uses regression models to predict future lung health risks based on current damage data.

## Datasets
